                Today marks the beginning of my journey to becoming a programmer. I have always been fascinated by how websites and apps work, and I have decided to learn how to create them myself. In particular, I wants to be an expert in photo and video editor.
            </p>
            <p class="green">
                It started when a friend shared an advert for free Web Development Course by one of the most prestigious NGO in the health sector in Nigeria, eHealth Africa. I got an email on Aughust 22, 2024 that I am selected to partipate after filling the form online. We took a basic course on Udemy and on 31st Aughust, 2024, we had an aptitude test. I was lucky to be selected despite my poor background in web development. On 20th September, after we had our personality test, we had our fisrt lesson in eHA Academy. We learned how to set-up our environment, installed a text editor, learned some basic commands, and completed my first "Hello World" program in HTML. It feels amazing to see something I wrote come to life!

                Today, I started learning HTML and CSS, the building blocks of web development. I learned how to structure content using tags. It is amazing how adding a few tags can turn plain text into a well-organized webpage.
            </p>
            <p class="brown">
                CSS has been even more exciting. I experimented with different colors, fonts, and layouts. Styling my page makes it feel uniquely mine. Here is an example of something I worked on today:
            </p>
            <p class="yellow">
                body {
                    font-family: 'Arial, sans-serif';
                    color: #333;
                }
                h1 {
                    text-align: center;
                    color: #00509e;
                }
            </p>
            <p class="brown">It is a small start, but I am proud of it.</p>
